<h1 align="center"> Welcome to Forge 42  </h1>
<h3 align="center">✨ Shaping the future of Developer experience ✨ </h1>
 

Our vision is to disrupt and reshape the development landscape, pioneering a future where developer experience sets new standards of excellence and innovation.

## Values / Principles

- We are **customer-focused**, meaning we strive to anticipate and innovate according to our customers' needs, rather than simply responding to their requests.
- We are team players because we are aware that the **whole is greater than the sum of of the parts**.
- We **strive** for the **simplest solutions**, adhering to **standards** and reusing existing solutions when practical. However, we’re not hesitant to **challenge the status quo** if it can lead to meaningful improvements.
- **Continuous improvement over perfection**: we believe in iterative and self-improving processes to deliver the best possible outcome at the given time
- We **are proud about our successes and mistakes**, as they indicate we’ve taken risks, learned, and grew from them.
- We are **reliable and trustworthy partners**, because we hold ourselves accountable to our promises. Each promise carries weight, showing our commitment to deliver on our own words

## Mission

Our mission is to deliver powerful, user-friendly, and intuitive products for single software engineers, and small teams - like we are at the moment - to boost our/their productivity to help deliver ideas faster at a higher quality with less manual effort, in a repeatable way.
