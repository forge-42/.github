<h1 align="center"> Welcome to Forge 42  </h1>
<h3 align="center">‚ú® Shaping the future of Developer experience ‚ú® </h1>
 

Our vision is to disrupt and reshape the development landscape, pioneering a future where developer experience sets new standards of excellence and innovation.

## üßô Values / Principles

- We are **customer-focused**, meaning we strive to anticipate and innovate according to our customers' needs, rather than simply responding to their requests.
- We are team players because we are aware that the **whole is greater than the sum of of the parts**.
- We **strive** for the **simplest solutions**, adhering to **standards** and reusing existing solutions when practical. However, we‚Äôre not hesitant to **challenge the status quo** if it can lead to meaningful improvements.
- **Continuous improvement over perfection**: we believe in iterative and self-improving processes to deliver the best possible outcome at the given time
- We **are proud about our successes and mistakes**, as they indicate we‚Äôve taken risks, learned, and grew from them.
- We are **reliable and trustworthy partners**, because we hold ourselves accountable to our promises. Each promise carries weight, showing our commitment to deliver on our own words

## üë©‚Äçüíª Mission

Our mission is to deliver powerful, user-friendly, and intuitive products for single software engineers, and small teams - like we are at the moment - to boost our/their productivity to help deliver ideas faster at a higher quality with less manual effort, in a repeatable way.

## üçø Open source

We are commited to bringing value through open-source and one of the core beliefs of our company is that good software should be shared. As a part of that mission we aim to deliver help through various free tools we offer for the community such as VS code extensions, vite plugins and Remix.run OSS packages.

We welcome any contributions to our open-source work and any contribution, no matter how big or small, is a huge help!
