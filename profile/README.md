<h1 align="center"> Welcome to Forge 42 </h1>
<h3 align="center">✨ Shaping the future of Developer experience ✨ </h1>

Our mission is to deliver user-friendly and powerful products, platforms, and services that set the standard for developer experience and promote best practices. Committed to our roots, we actively support the open-source spirit by creating, maintaining and contributing to open-source software but also by providing valuable educational content on various relevant channels.


We also want to create a thriving open-source community through engaging content and open-source projects where people can come together and share their opinions and grow together. We want to be something much more than another IT company, we want to be a driver in the industry and help shape the future. 


Our goal is to empower every developer with the tools and knowledge to succeed. We provide tools to make you succeed faster and get your products shipped to production.

If you wish to help us, help others, consider contributing to our open-source community projects!
